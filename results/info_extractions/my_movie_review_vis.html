&quot;&quot;&quot;
Earthly disasters possibly caused by a creator who has been absent as the world has lost 
hope—the religious allegory embedded in “Ad Astra” is <span class="lx-highlight lx-current-highlight" data-idx="0" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">crystal clear</span> if you look for it, but 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="1" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">never highlighted in a way that takes away from the film’s urgency</span>. Science fiction is often 
about search for meaning, but this one literally tells the story of man’s quest to find He who 
created him and get some answers, including why He left us behind. McBride’s journey 
takes him first to the moon, which has been briefly <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="2" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">reimagined as a tourist trap</span>, complete 
with a Subway, and then to Mars, which is the furthest reach that man has colonized. As in 
Gray’s last film, “The Lost City of Z,” there’s <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="3" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">an element of how journey and exploration 
change a man</span>. The hero with the perfect BPM starts to feel his pulse elevate as he leaves 
the comforts of his routine and his home, and as the stakes of his adventure rise. And Gray 
never loses the human intimacy of his story, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="4" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">keeping us tied to McBride’s POV, experiencing 
only what he does and knowing only what he does</span>. The result is a film that <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="5" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">feels both 
massive and deeply personal with its themes</span>, which is <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="6" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">no easy feat</span>. 

Don’t get me wrong, while this is a deeply philosophical film there are also <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="7" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">traditional 
action elements</span> and what <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="8" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">feel like real stakes</span> throughout McBride’s journey. People die. 
People make mistakes. People are selfish, scared, and greedy. It feels like McBride’s 
encounters with others along his journey, including characters played by Donald 
Sutherland and Ruth Negga, are <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="9" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">designed to illuminate the humanity within him</span>. The 
perfect man who fell to Earth becomes imperfect as he reaches ever closer to his creator, 
and as he sees the imperfections of those around him. 

Through it all, Pitt carries the emotional and physical weight in <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="10" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">one of the most subtle and 
graceful performances of his career</span>. A lot of directors would have been too enraptured with 
the grandeur of the space around him or the details of the interstellar travel, but Gray 
allows the camera to linger on Pitt’s face in ways no other director really has before, and it 
leads to what’s <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="11" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">arguably Pitt’s most complex performance</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="12" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Pitt avoids showy choices at 
every turn</span>, but <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="13" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">he also doesn’t err in the other direction and make McBride too stoic</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="14" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">It’s a 
perfectly calibrated performance</span>. With his work here and in “Once Upon a Time … in 
Hollywood,” <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="15" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">2019 is the best year of his career</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="16" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">They’re both instant classic performances</span>, 
and in such completely different ways, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="17" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">illustrate his underrated range as an actor</span>. 

Of course, as with all of Gray’s films, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="18" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the craftsmanship here is top-notch</span>. The delicate use 
of color in different sections of the film from the black-and-white of the moon to a rusty red 
of Mars and beyond <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="19" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">makes for a mesmerizing visual palette</span>, and the cinematography by
&quot;&quot;&quot;

**Page 2**
&quot;&quot;&quot;
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="20" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Hoyte Van Hoytema sometimes echoes his work on “Interstellar”</span> in how it <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="21" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">balances 
extreme close-ups of masked space travelers with the vastness of space</span>. Also <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="22" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">particularly 
effective is the score by Max Richter</span>, which is somehow both <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="23" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">intimately eerie and grandiose 
at the same time</span>.  

We are in an era of what some are calling highbrow sci-fi as films like “Gravity,” “Arrival,” and 
“Interstellar” make high profits and reap major awards consideration. Neither seems likely 
for “Ad Astra.” <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="24" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">It’s a bit too strange to be a major box office hit</span>, and it’s being released by a 
studio in flux as it transitions to Disney ownership. Still, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="25" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">time will be kind to Gray’s film</span>. It 
may take place in the future, but <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="26" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">it says something that will always be current</span> about our 
quest for meaning in a world in which it sometimes feels like that which we used to believe 
in and rely on no longer comforts us in the same way. “Ad Astra” is <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="27" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">deeply moving</span> with <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="28" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">lines 
and ideas in its final scenes that <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="29" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">worked on my emotions in ways I wasn’t at all expecting</span></span>. 
Be patient with it. Invest in it. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="30" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">The destination is worth the journey</span>.
