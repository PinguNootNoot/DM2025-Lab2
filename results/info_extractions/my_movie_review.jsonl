if you look for it, but \nnever highlighted in a way that takes away from the film’s urgency. Science fiction is often \nabout search for meaning, but this one literally tells the story of man’s quest to find He who \ncreated him and get some answers, including why He left us behind. McBride’s journey \ntakes him first to the moon, which has been briefly reimagined as a tourist trap, complete \nwith a Subway, and then to Mars, which is the furthest reach that man has colonized. As in \nGray’s last film, “The Lost City of Z,” there’s an element of how journey and exploration \nchange a man. The hero with the perfect BPM starts to feel his pulse elevate as he leaves \nthe comforts of his routine and his home, and as the stakes of his adventure rise. And Gray \nnever loses the human intimacy of his story, keeping us tied to McBride’s POV, experiencing \nonly what he does and knowing only what he does. The result is a film that feels both \nmassive and deeply personal with its themes, which is no easy feat. \n \nDon’t get me wrong, while this is a deeply philosophical film there are also traditional \naction elements and what feel like real stakes throughout McBride’s journey. People die. \nPeople make mistakes. People are selfish, scared, and greedy. It feels like McBride’s \nencounters with others along his journey, including characters played by Donald \nSutherland and Ruth Negga, are designed to illuminate the humanity within him. The \nperfect man who fell to Earth becomes imperfect as he reaches ever closer to his creator, \nand as he sees the imperfections of those around him. \n \nThrough it all, Pitt carries the emotional and physical weight in one of the most subtle and \ngraceful performances of his career. A lot of directors would have been too enraptured with \nthe grandeur of the space around him or the details of the interstellar travel, but Gray \nallows the camera to linger on Pitt’s face in ways no other director really has before, and it \nleads to what’s arguably Pitt’s most complex performance. Pitt avoids showy choices at \nevery turn, but he also doesn’t err in the other direction and make McBride too stoic. It’s a \nperfectly calibrated performance. With his work here and in “Once Upon a Time … in \nHollywood,” 2019 is the best year of his career. They’re both instant classic performances, \nand in such completely different ways, illustrate his underrated range as an actor. \n \nOf course, as with all of Gray’s films, the craftsmanship here is top-notch. The delicate use \nof color in different sections of the film from the black-and-white of the moon to a rusty red \nof Mars and beyond makes for a mesmerizing visual palette, and the cinematography by\n\"\"\"\n\n**Page 2**\n\"\"\"\nHoyte Van Hoytema sometimes echoes his work on “Interstellar” in how it balances \nextreme close-ups of masked space travelers with the vastness of space. Also particularly \neffective is the score by Max Richter, which is somehow both intimately eerie and grandiose \nat the same time.  \n \nWe are in an era of what some are calling highbrow sci-fi as films like “Gravity,” “Arrival,” and \n“Interstellar” make high profits and reap major awards consideration. Neither seems likely \nfor “Ad Astra.” It’s a bit too strange to be a major box office hit, and it’s being released by a \nstudio in flux as it transitions to Disney ownership. Still, time will be kind to Gray’s film. It \nmay take place in the future, but it says something that will always be current about our \nquest for meaning in a world in which it sometimes feels like that which we used to believe \nin and rely on no longer comforts us in the same way. “Ad Astra” is deeply moving with lines \nand ideas in its final scenes that worked on my emotions in ways I wasn’t at all expecting. \nBe patient with it. Invest in it. The destination is worth the journey.\n\"\"\"\n\n", "document_id": "doc_e9644359"}
