       "That's an excellent question that gets to the heart of the song's meaning. The person mentioned in the lyric \"I still wake up, I still see your ghost\" is not a specific, named individual. Instead, the \"ghost\" is a powerful metaphor that can be interpreted in a couple of key ways, which are likely intertwined.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 1. The Ghost of a Former Self\n",
       "\n",
       "The most widely accepted interpretation is that the \"ghost\" is **the singer's own former self**. The song, written by Fun.'s lead singer Nate Ruess, is a deeply personal and anxious reflection on newfound fame and the loss of identity that can come with it.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Context:** The album *Some Nights* was the band's breakout success. The song captures the dizzying feeling of achieving a dream but feeling lost and unsure of who you've become in the process.\n",
       "*   **The Lyrics:** The line \"I still see your ghost\" is immediately followed by **\"Oh Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for.\"** This connection is crucial. The ghost he sees is the person he used to be—someone who perhaps had a clearer sense of purpose, simpler values, or a life without the pressures of the public eye. Waking up and \"seeing\" that ghost is a painful daily reminder of how much he has changed and the identity he feels he has lost.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 2. The Ghost of a Past Relationship\n",
       "\n",
       "A more literal, and also valid, interpretation is that the ghost represents **a lost love or a significant person from his past**.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Evidence in the Song:** Later in the song, there's a verse that points directly to a past relationship:\n",
       "    > \"The other night, you wouldn't believe the dream I just had about you and me / I called you up, but we'd both agree / It's for the best you didn't listen.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **The Connection:** In this view, the memory of this person haunts him. This past relationship might symbolize the simpler, pre-fame life he left behind. The loss of that person is tangled up with his larger existential crisis, making their memory a \"ghost\" that represents everything he's no longer a part of.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Conclusion\n",
       "\n",
       "Ultimately, the brilliance of the lyric is that it can be both at once. The \"ghost\" is a haunting memory that fuels the singer's central conflict. It most likely represents **the person he was before fame, with the memory of a specific lost love serving as a powerful symbol of that entire lost life.**\n",
       "\n",
       "So, while it's not one identifiable person, the \"ghost\" is the embodiment of the past that the singer can't escape as he struggles with his present."

It's also easy to see that it didn't spend too much time on finding the information that is related to the contents of the prompt.\n",

    "**Gemini-2.5-pro**\n",
    "- Apparently, Gemini-pro took much more time in finding related information (the execution time is notably longer), the response is more concrete and the answer being more certain. The model elaborated on the connections between the lyrics and the singer's life experience, which explained the question in the prompt very clearly. It even found the \"source\", which was stated as non-existing by the flash-lite model, that backed its answer. The contents in its response are more detailed, natural, and more poetic.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Changes on the System Prompt**\n",
    "- This will surely change the fashion of how Gemini answer our main prompt. It can be deliberative, cautious, sticking to the ground truth by default, or dive into a world with no limitation and come up with a response with pure creativity as instructed."

    "By default, an LLM responds with unstructured, free-form text.

       " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nDan Baldwin\\nGroup 4\\nAuteur Review - Interstellar \\nI believe Christopher Nolan: the director behind the 2014 sci-ﬁ/adventure cinematic ‘Interstellar,’ \\nto be a very intellectual and imaginative inventive talent.  \\nHis style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \\nface, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \\nexample, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \\ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \\nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \\ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \\nthemselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \\nThis brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \\nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \\nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \\ntravel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \\nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \\nplanets. \\nThroughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \\nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \\n‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \\nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \\nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \\nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \\nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \\nAt the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \\ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \\nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \\nThe imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \\nwonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \\nthem to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \\nbamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \\nwatch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \\nwill one day come true. \\nOverall, ‘Interstellar’ is a clear example of Nolan’s auteur talent, as he once again ﬁgments yet \\nanother cluster of conditions for us to marvel at. With a fantastic score from world famous \\ncomposer Hanz Zimmer, his epic, orchestral theme sets the audience in the palm of his hands as \\nwe stress over how we are all going to be saved once again.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

       " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nEarthly disasters possibly caused by a creator who has been absent as the world has lost \\nhope—the religious allegory embedded in “Ad Astra” is crystal clear if you look for it, but \\nnever highlighted in a way that takes away from the film’s urgency. Science fiction is often \\nabout search for meaning, but this one literally tells the story of man’s quest to find He who \\ncreated him and get some answers, including why He left us behind. McBride’s journey \\ntakes him first to the moon, which has been briefly reimagined as a tourist trap, complete \\nwith a Subway, and then to Mars, which is the furthest reach that man has colonized. As in \\nGray’s last film, “The Lost City of Z,” there’s an element of how journey and exploration \\nchange a man. The hero with the perfect BPM starts to feel his pulse elevate as he leaves \\nthe comforts of his routine and his home, and as the stakes of his adventure rise. And Gray \\nnever loses the human intimacy of his story, keeping us tied to McBride’s POV, experiencing \\nonly what he does and knowing only what he does. The result is a film that feels both \\nmassive and deeply personal with its themes, which is no easy feat. \\n \\nDon’t get me wrong, while this is a deeply philosophical film there are also traditional \\naction elements and what feel like real stakes throughout McBride’s journey. People die. \\nPeople make mistakes. People are selfish, scared, and greedy. It feels like McBride’s \\nencounters with others along his journey, including characters played by Donald \\nSutherland and Ruth Negga, are designed to illuminate the humanity within him. The \\nperfect man who fell to Earth becomes imperfect as he reaches ever closer to his creator, \\nand as he sees the imperfections of those around him. \\n \\nThrough it all, Pitt carries the emotional and physical weight in one of the most subtle and \\ngraceful performances of his career. A lot of directors would have been too enraptured with \\nthe grandeur of the space around him or the details of the interstellar travel, but Gray \\nallows the camera to linger on Pitt’s face in ways no other director really has before, and it \\nleads to what’s arguably Pitt’s most complex performance. Pitt avoids showy choices at \\nevery turn, but he also doesn’t err in the other direction and make McBride too stoic. It’s a \\nperfectly calibrated performance. With his work here and in “Once Upon a Time … in \\nHollywood,” 2019 is the best year of his career. They’re both instant classic performances, \\nand in such completely different ways, illustrate his underrated range as an actor. \\n \\nOf course, as with all of Gray’s films, the craftsmanship here is top-notch. The delicate use \\nof color in different sections of the film from the black-and-white of the moon to a rusty red \\nof Mars and beyond makes for a mesmerizing visual palette, and the cinematography by\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n**Page 2**\\n\"\"\"\\nHoyte Van Hoytema sometimes echoes his work on “Interstellar” in how it balances \\nextreme close-ups of masked space travelers with the vastness of space. Also particularly \\neffective is the score by Max Richter, which is somehow both intimately eerie and grandiose \\nat the same time.  \\n \\nWe are in an era of what some are calling highbrow sci-fi as films like “Gravity,” “Arrival,” and \\n“Interstellar” make high profits and reap major awards consideration. Neither seems likely \\nfor “Ad Astra.” It’s a bit too strange to be a major box office hit, and it’s being released by a \\nstudio in flux as it transitions to Disney ownership. Still, time will be kind to Gray’s film. It \\nmay take place in the future, but it says something that will always be current about our \\nquest for meaning in a world in which it sometimes feels like that which we used to believe \\nin and rely on no longer comforts us in the same way. “Ad Astra” is deeply moving with lines \\nand ideas in its final scenes that worked on my emotions in ways I wasn’t at all expecting. \\nBe patient with it. Invest in it. The destination is worth the journey.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

    "The example prompt focuses on the different sentiments of reviews and the audience's reactions, and the causes for them. This did help capture some key points in the second movie review. Nevertheless, I think this kind of emphasis may involuntarily ignore the details that are mentioned through plain words or the narrative itself. One of the example in this movie is: color. **Ad Astra** is a movie that consists of many monologues from the protagonist, as well as numerous visual-stunning scenes to reflect the mood and the mindset of the protagonist. These elements contribute substantially to the development of the plot, and eventually the changes that, which the audience can witness, occur on the protagonist."

    "\n",
    "*   **Contextual Understanding:** Unlike older methods, LLM embeddings are contextual. The vector for a word like **\"bank\"** will be different depending on whether it's used in the context of a \"river bank\" or a \"money bank,\" providing a more nuanced representation of language.\n",

The data points from the same group seem to be mixed with the ones from another group. However, after switching to a different camera view in the 3D projection, that changes a lot. Some data points of an emotion can be seen clustering as a group, while few of them scatter and are closer to the points of other emotions. This appears both in the 2D and 3D plot, but the difference is that it's better to observe certain patterns or relations between the data points of the same emotion due to the additional information given by the extra dimension."

    "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where a language model combines document retrieval with text generation. In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, we will load a webpage as a document, which allows us to retrieve text from a URL. After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

    "Few-shot prompting is a technique where a Large Language Model (LLM) is given a small number of labeled examples within a prompt to guide its classification. This allows the model to perform a new task with minimal data, avoiding the need for extensive fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "*   **Zero-shot:** The model classifies text without any prior examples.\n",
    "*   **1-shot:** The model is given one example for each emotion before classifying.\n",
    "*   **5-shot:** The model is given five examples per emotion for better context.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make our implementation robust and efficient, we are incorporating two key features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Structured Output:** We provide the Gemini model with a specific output schema (`Emotions` class). This instructs the model to return *only* a valid emotion label (e.g., `joy`), which makes the output predictable and reliable, minimizing errors.\n",
    "2.  **API Rate Handling:** The code includes a function to manage the requests-per-minute limit of the Gemini API.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will test the model's performance on a small sample of 20 texts per emotion to ensure the process runs quickly. If the model provides an invalid response, the code will automatically retry the request until a valid classification is received.\n",

    "From zero to 5-shot, the accuracy of each emotion label improves due to the increase in training data. However, as we can see, the extra training data misled the model into making wrong predictions in some cases. For example, from 1-shot to 5-shot, the numbers of instances that are labeled correctly in \"joy\" and \"fear\" decreased, while the numbers of True-Positive in \"anger\" and \"sadness\" increased. In zero-shot learning, the model can learn some hidden features that belong to certain classes, but this may change after some examples are provided since they can also contain noises at the same time, affecting the model's performance."

For this you need to load the results with pandas and handle the data using its dataframe functions. Discuss about the findings."

    "\n",
    "After reviewing the prediction results in each learning category, I found out something that I consider to be far more interesting, and it may be the reason for causing some cases being **incorrectly classified**. The thing is that, some \"ground truths\" or \"true labels\" in the data are basically wrong or misleading, according to my observation. Let's see some examples below:<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "***you are on an endless journey of figuring yourself out; don't be discouraged when you don't know who you are yet.***\n",
    "- The true label of this comment is \"sadness\", but we can clearly see that the meaning of it is to tell someone to keep going even if uncertainty is one's sole companion. Maybe the emotion being expressed here is somewhat gloomy, but it is assuring that self-exploration is a journey to have. At last, \"don't be discouraged\" shows positivity, in which one person supports another.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "***@AttentiAlGatto LOL! Why would it scare me? It doesn't make any sense at all but it doesn't scare me! {chuckles}***\n",
    "- The true label of this comment is \"fear\". However, I believe that the true emotion cannot be determined without the contexts. Maybe, the person who is saying this is not afraid at all and even feel amused. Or, he is being sarcastic.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "***Trying to book holiday flights on @britishairways website is becoming a #nightmare***\n",
    "- The true label of this comment is \"fear\". I think we don't need explanation to see that it is a complaint expressing that the person is annoyed, unsatisfied, unhappy. If we have to classify it, the label \"anger\" will be better than \"fear\".<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "***@airtelindia have some issues with my broadband bill, I am charged for the month before I signed up with airtel.. #hilarious***\n",
    "- The true label of this comment is \"joy\", but as we can see, this person is describing something absurd that made him/her laugh a little. The prediction is \"anger\", which is not identical to the ground truth but is actually closer to the original meaning.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Utilizing only 4 labels to categorize different emotions can be problematic, like the examples demonstrated above. Human emotions are sophisticated, nuanced, and rich in variety. People can choose to bluntly express or metaphorically convey these feelings. What's more, they may also use sarcasm to achieve specific purposes. In sum, the model learned incorrect information since part of the true labels are misleading. However, we can still see that the model made a few predictions that are more accurate compared to their ground truths. I think this is because it captured the keywords which derived from the comments with correct true labels. Without contexts and extra info, it is hard to make a machine understand what's behind these complex symbols that have been evolving for dozens of centuries."

    "- **Advanced topic - QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter):** QLoRA is a method used to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
