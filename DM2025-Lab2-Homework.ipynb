The `first two phases` refer to the `exercises inside the Master notebooks` of the [DM2025-Lab2-Exercise Repo](https://github.com/difersalest/DM2025-Lab2-Exercise.git). The `third phase` refers to an `internal Kaggle competition` that we are gonna run among all the Data Mining students. Together they add up to `100 points` of your grade. There are also some `bonus points` to be gained if you complete `extra exercises` in the lab **(bonus 15 pts)** and in the `Kaggle Competition report` **(bonus 5 pts)**.\n",

    "- **Phase 2 exercises:** We use Gemini's API so everything can be run with only CPU without a problem.\n",
    "- **Phase 3 exercises:** For the competition you will probably need GPU to train your models, so it is recommended to use Colab or Kaggle if you don't have a laptop with a dedicated GPU.\n",
    "- **Optional Ollama Notebook (not graded):** You need GPU, at least 4GB of VRAM with 16 GB of RAM to run the local open-source LLM models. \n",

    "- To improve the accuracy (f1-score), I made some changes to the learning rate, number of training epochs, and the architecture of my Roberta model.\n",
    "- Originally, I used TF-IDF vectorizor with a simple Feed-Forward linear model to do the task, but the result was not satisfying.\n",
    "- After switching to Roberta, the overall performance (f1-score) increased significantly (approximately +1).\n",
    "\n",
    "One interest thing is that, to address the \"misleading true label\" problem I mentioned in Phase 2, I initially intended to generate additional **virtual texts** for each Twitter comment by packing all the data into a single prompt and input them into Gemini (data augmentation).<br/>The first few results seemed promising, but this attempt was soon abandoned due to the fact of the amount of data exceeded the quota which Gemini had to offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Mention Insights You Gained\n",
    "\n",
    "- The data still suffer from the same problem it had in the Phase 2 main exercise. The labels lack in variety, and sometimes do not match the real emotions behind the corresponding texts (e.g. misled by sarcasm).\n",
    "- Choose approaches that best fit the \"essences\" of the data. I hate to quit trying out different methods due to the deadline being around the corner, otherwise I would like to explore a little more.\n",
